#### Last week in freight

The markets this week have been low for vans and reefers. There have been relatively more loads from California, Texas, Pennsylvania. For reefers, this list expands by Illinois and Missouri. On average, there have been a livelier market for reefers this week. Particularly, Sioux Falls, Lubbock, Augusta and Kansas City markets had low demand for dry vans but a considerable demand for the reefers. This has to do with the crops season, which is inelastic to the rest of the economic conditions.

The fall in spot rates for reefers has stabilized and only declined from 3.07$ in May to 3.03$ in June, which brings the optimism. The contract rates for reefers have been increasing since March, which indicates the overall expectation by shippers that the spot rates will rise even further due to the rising diesel prices. 

For dry vans, though, the spot rates are significantly lower at 2.71$ instead of 3.30$ for contract rates. The decline in prices has also stabilized in June. 

The loads to trucks ratio for reefers has been double than that of vans. The markets have been stabilizing since May and have never fallen lower than the lockdown lows of 2020.

#### General market news

Fuel prices continue to increase and the crude oil increased faster last two weeks, which signals a further increase in diesel prices. The inflation is all time high at 8.6%, compared to May 2021. However, no spikes due to the war in Ukraine.
